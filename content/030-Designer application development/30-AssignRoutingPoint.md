## Assign Routing Point for Voice

Once a Designer application has been created, you can assign it a Route Point. 

- Click on the line of one of your applications.
- Click on [Manage]:

- Click on the internal route point you want to assign to the app:

> Notice that the Unit ID for this example is 12. Your numbers will change accordigly for your specific Unit ID. 

Your internal route point has been assigned:

You can use 2 shared DIDs (local numbers in North America and in UK) that will automatically map to Internal DIDs that you can assign to your application.

You can then call the external route points of the group you assigned to your application. In the above example, call +1 (650) 337-3811 because you assigned the application to group 1. This call should be routed to one of your logged in and ready agents.

## Clone a Template Application

As an alternative to creating a Designer Application manually, assigning a Chat Endpoint, and Assigning a Route Point for Voice, it is possible to clone a template application with many channels already integrated.

On the Azure EOD Portal login to Designer with your user of role Administrator (refer to 'Login Information' section on how to find users). 
note: Tenant is left blank.

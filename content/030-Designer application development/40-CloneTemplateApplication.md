## Clone a Template Application

As an alternative to creating a Designer Application manually, assigning a Chat Endpoint, and Assigning a Route Point for Voice, it is possible to clone a template application with many channels already integrated.

On the Azure EOD Portal login to Designer with your user of role Administrator (refer to 'Login Information' section on how to find users). 
note: Tenant is left blank.

The template application for the unit shows in the Applications list. Its name includes the unit name, and the template build number. For example for unit U203, in the following image B9 is the template build number. Over time, we will publish new builds of the template application so keep an eye on the template build number and description to stay up to date.

Click on the table row that contains the template (not on the template name which is a link, but on the row). The description will populate on the right. The description for the application is useful to know what is included with the build.

> NOTE! : the Template is a standard application that can be edited and associated to a route point or chat endpoint but we strongly recommend that you do not edit or use the application directly. Instead, you must clone the application before modifying or using it.

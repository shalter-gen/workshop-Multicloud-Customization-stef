## Assign Chat Endpoint then Test
Once a Designer application has been created, assign it a chat endpoint. 

- Within Designer, under Applications, in the Application table, click on the row of one of your applications.
- Click on [Manage Chat Endpoints]. 
 
>tip - click on the row of the app, not on the name of the app.

- In the [Assign an EServices Endpoint] window, enter the desired chat endpoint name.

     - Preferably, name it after your unit name.
     - The naming convention is U##_ChatEndpoint_#. 
     - For instance U39_ChatEndpoint_1, where ## is your unit id.
     - Click OK

- You can now test a chat.

      - Have your Azure EOD Personal agent logged into Agent Desktop on the Portal and make them ready.
      - Go to this page - Widgets Demo. 
      - Paste your chat endpoint. Make sure to enter the name of the endpoint and not the name of the application.
      - Select the stream in your Designer application (typically [dev])
      - Hit [Submit]

       - This opens a new window with the widget on the right side of the page.
       - Open the widget to start a chat.
       - Fill up the chat registration form and hit [Start Chat].        
       - Note that you can also use the default "Treasure_Bank_Service" endpoint.

## Managing Toast Data, and Dispositions

>Note: if you override Toast Data or Disposition, the global definition of Toast Data or Disposition (defined under "Contact Center Settings") will be entirely replaced with what you define at the agent group level. This means that if you want to preserve the global definition (and add your own Toast Data or Disposition), you will have to copy the global Toast Data or Disposition entries into your setting at the agent group level.

To manage Toast Data and Dispositions, the process is very similar to the process for Case Data, above. Just select the other items in [Agent Group].

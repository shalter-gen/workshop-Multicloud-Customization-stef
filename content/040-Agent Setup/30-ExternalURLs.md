## Managing External URLs

> Note: if you override External URLs, the global definition of External URLs (defined under "Contact Center Settings") will be entirely replaced with what you define at the agent group level. This means that if you want to preserve the global definition (and add your own External URLs), you will have to copy the global External URLs entries into your setting at the agent group level.


- Navigate to [Agent Groups] / U###-AgentGroup / [Agent Group] / [External URLs]
- Set the Level (Workspace or Interaction) and the display type (Internal, external, background, hidden)
- Enter a label and URL.

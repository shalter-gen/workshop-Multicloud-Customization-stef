## Managing Skills




Click on the Agent Setup tile within the Azure EOD Portal, and login with your EOD Personal user of role Administrator. (refer to the 'Login Information' section on how to find users). 
Navigate to [Contact Center Settings] / [Skills] .
On the right panel, click on the [GDemo] folder icon to get into the [GDemo] folder.


Click on the [U###] folder. This folder is owned by the unit and the unit admin has create/update/delete permissions on this folder to handle objects of the selected type (Case Data in this example).


Click on [+Add] .
Enter the new skill name of your choice. Note that the system requires this name to be unique in the entire tenant. A good idea is to prefix the name with the unit identifier (U### for example) to minimize the risk of name collision.


Click on [Save] to apply the changes!
